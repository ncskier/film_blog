The trailer for _A Serious Man_ is weird, creative, and darkly entertaining. I think it's brilliant how the trailer creates its music through the repetitious weaving of sound bytes (if you can call it music – let's call it _sound-byte-music_). Not only does the _sound-byte-music_ create an offputtingly unique atmosphere, but it also conveys a feeling through its repeated phrases; we feel Larry's struggle between internally "I need help" and externally "we're gonna be fine." Also, the trailer plays as a miniature movie with perfect shifts in pacing. It's entertaining and really sells a dark comedic Cohen Brothers movie.
