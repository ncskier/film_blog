I just saw this film last night and am still not sure how to properly put my feelings into words. However, the one thing I can properly articulate is that Blade Runner 2049 was visually and audibly stunning! Go see this film in the best theater around, because it is something that needs to be _experienced_. The film is so immersive and watching it, I sometimes felt like my senses were being overwhelmed (in the best way possible). So, here's the announcement trailer which gives you a little taste of the incredible experience that is Blade Runner 2049.
