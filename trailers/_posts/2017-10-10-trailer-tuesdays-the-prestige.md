This trailer's amazing. It's intriguing without really giving away anything major in the film. And, I love how it explains to you the three acts _the pledge_, _the turn_, and _the prestige_ hinting at how they relate to the events and characters in the film.

Also, this trailer has some of the best title cards I've ever seen. Usually, I filter out title cards and find them annoying; however, these capture my attention through their brilliant sound design and animation. They feel organic. Like they belong in the trailer, as opposed to being last-minute additions required for marketing purposes.
