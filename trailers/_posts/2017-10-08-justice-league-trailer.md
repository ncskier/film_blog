Surprisingly enough, this is the first _Justice League_ trailer that actually got me a little excited about the movie. Maybe it was just the David Bowie song _Heroes_ emitting good vibes, reminding me of how much I enjoyed _Stranger Things_. Or, maybe it was that I just finished watching _My Hero Academia_ Season 2 yesterday and am still enamored by that show's inspirational and hopeful vision of what it means to be a hero. You know what; it most likely was just my feelings towards _Stranger Things_ and _My Hero Academia_ that got me excited watching this trailer.

However, I'm inclined to hope that this trailer actually had some merit to it and that _Justice League_ has the potential to be a good film. I still despise the overabundance of CGI in this trailer (and I know you're thinking that they'll polish up the graphics by the time the film's released, but I counter your hypothetical argument with _Batman vs. Superman_, which failed to meet my CGI standards, making me very worried about the CGI this time around – sorry; I'm getting distracted). This trailer got me hoping that _Justice League_ can succeed on a narrative level and show audiences the importance of unity in the face of adversity, and what it truly means to be a hero!

At the heart of this little post, I'm recommending that if you haven't watched them yet, you should definitely check out _Stranger Things_ and _My Hero Academia_. _My Hero Academia_ perfectly captures the idealistic image of what a hero should be (similar to what Superman is supposed to be and what he is supposed to stand for). I hope _Justice League_ ends up being a good movie, or at least an enjoyable film. But if it isn't, there are still thousands of amazing superhero stories you can enjoy in film, tv, comics, and novels!
