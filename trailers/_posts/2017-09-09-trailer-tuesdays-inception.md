I love this trailer mostly because of the visual imagery and outstanding music. And, whether for better or for worse, it introduced cinematic BWAAAS to the world.

I also really like this other Inception trailer below. It's shorter, but I think it has a better ending than the above one. I dislike when trailers (like the one above) end with a quick quip. It usually feels disjointed and undermines the trailer's lasting effect.
