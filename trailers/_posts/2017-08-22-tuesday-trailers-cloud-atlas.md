This has one of my favorite trailer music moments: the ending part with the
awesome song _Outro_ by _M83_. Alex and I used to be slightly obsessed with
_Outro_ and its use in this trailer. Inspired by the _Cloud Atlas_ trailer's use
of _Outro_, Alex even created
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0Qh0z49Gf0">this trailer</a>
of _James Joyce_'s novel _A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man_ for a school
project.
