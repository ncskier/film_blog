Turn on your best speakers (you know, the ones with the bass) and watch this on a TV if you can â€“ it'll be worth the extra effort (especially if you've never seen this trailer before).

Now, remember how to inhale, and take your first breath in roughly 3 minutes (after you're done watching the trailer for the second time).

If you can't tell, I think this is a staggeringly brilliant trailer. I was fortunate enough to get blindsided by this _The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo_ trailer while in a movie theater. Today, I have absolutely no idea what film I was at the movies to see because all I remember from that theater experience was this trailer. This trailer provided, by far, my top trailer-watching experience of all time. It is simply awesome!

When I saw this trailer, I had no idea what it was for. Unlike _Marvel_, _Start Wars_, etc. franchise properties today which put out great trailers made better by their established brands (_~cough~_ Star Wars nostalgia _~cough~_) this trailer doesn't need any support. It just punches you right in the face (in a good way) with its quick edits and killer music. This punch to the face is the perfect tone for _The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo_ as is creates intrigue from the dark, grim mystery it establishes.

The trailer doesn't use words to tell you anything. Instead, it masterfully sets up intrigue using music and visual storytelling from very short clips. By the end of the trailer, I know there's some sort of investigation going on, a girl is involved, murder is most likely the crime, and _Daniel Craig_ has figured something out. Oh, and I also know this is a going to be a dark, twisted movie. The quick edits in time with the _Led Zepplin_ _Immigrant Song_ cover set up the harsh frenetic tone perfectly. Shout out to the brilliant font for doing this as well; trailer fonts sometimes go unappreciated, and this font's fantastic.

One last thought before I end up gushing too much about why I love this trailer. That snowy house!!! I love how the trailer slowly brings you closer and closer to the snowy house, drawing you into the trailer visually. At the same time, it's showing you bits and pieces of a mystery, drawing you into the trailer mentally. So by the time you reach the house at the end of the road, you are completely invested and are intrigued by the visual threads of the trailer.
