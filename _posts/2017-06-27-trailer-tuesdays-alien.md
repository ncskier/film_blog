It's old, but it's so awesome! If you haven't seen it yet, here's the _Alien_ trailer in all its glory. It gives you a perfect taste of the _Alien_ experience. The trailer places you in the isolation of space, starting out slow and dialing up the tension brilliantly with some music and an absolutely iconic sound effect. The _Alien_ trailer also doesn't show too much (like many trailers today). It conveys the tense tone of _Alien_ and only shows you enough to pique your interest.

The film was released in 1979 and yet the trailer barely feels outdated (besides the not-so-great image and sound quality). I think this is an outstanding trailer and it is one of my favorite trailers to date. The _Alien_ trailer was really my only choice to kick off the _Trailer Tuesday_ posts.
