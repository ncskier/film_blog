I have now seen Guy Ritchie's _King Arthur: Legend of the Sword_ twice in theaters, and I had a blast both times. This movie is awesome, and I urge anyone who happens upon this post to give it a shot. Watching _King Arthur_ was the most fun I've had at the movies in a long time.

I was very impressed by the direction, score, and editing in _King Arthur_. Almost every moment is infused with a style and energy that kept the movie exciting and fresh. Watching this movie was like nothing else I had seen recently, the clips are sewn together in a unique overlapping fashion. Many of the scenes are cut to an incredible score by Daniel Pemberton which adds almost as much character to the movie as the direction, editing, and script. There is rarely any down time either. _King Arthur_ is a loud, fun time at the movies.

Now, I'm not saying this is a flawless movie by any means. The plot is conventional, the characters are one-dimensional (although likable), and there is some not-so-great CGI in here. However, _King Arthur_ is _my_ kind of summer popcorn movie. The fantastic score by Daniel Pemberton and stylish dialogue/direction/editing by Guy Ritchie have made _King Arthur_ stand out in my mind above all the other films I've seen recently (including _Logan_, _Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2_, and _Wonder Woman_). _King Arthur: Legend of the Sword_ is a film that is not afraid to be interesting or unconventional, and I had so much fun watching it!
