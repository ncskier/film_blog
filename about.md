This is our site about movies... and related topics (some tv and games might find
their way into this site). Hope you enjoy.

### Alex's Most Recently Consumed "Awesome" Media
_Fire Emblem Echoes_  
I freaking love Fire Emblem, and this game certainly didn't disappoint. Just listen to that opening theme! The soundtrack and presentation alone make the game awesome, not to mention the great characters and gameplay.

### Brandon's Most Recently Consumed "Awesome" Media
_King Arthur: Legend of the Sword_  
Don't judge _King Arthur_ before you watch it; this is an incredibly enjoyable film! I was absolutely astounded by how much fun I had watching _King Arthur_. It is definitely not a film for everyone, but this was such a refreshing watch in the midst of some bland/mediocre theater releases.
