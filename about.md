This is our site about movies... and related topics (some tv and games might find
their way into this site). Hope you enjoy.

### Alex's Most Recent "Wow"
_Koe No Katachi (A Silent Voice)_  
Despite being overshadowed by _Your Name_ when it comes to media attention (and despite not even having a current US release), _Koe No Katachi_ is right up there as one of the most emotional movie experiences I've had in recent memory. It also has an amazing soundtrack, so there's that.

### Brandon's Most Recent "Wow"
_King Arthur: Legend of the Sword_  
Don't judge _King Arthur_ before you watch it; this is an incredibly enjoyable film! I was absolutely astounded by how much fun I had watching _King Arthur_. It is definitely not a film for everyone, but this was such a refreshing watch in the midst of some bland/mediocre theater releases.
