I really love the build up of music in this trailer. Admittedly, I am quite the sucker for trailers cut in time to music. Also, the third trailer (below) is pretty awesome as well!

Oh, and this trailer (below) is also pretty great! I probably wouldn't have finished reading _The Great Gatsby_ for school if it wasn't for this one.
